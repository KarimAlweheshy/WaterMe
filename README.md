SwiftUI App to manage your garden

This is a leisure project i worked on a couple of days when my airbnb guests left my plants dry and managed to kill a couple of them.
It also served as a project to get first hands-on experience with SwiftUI.

The project is far from done but hopefully it demostrates how i Like to structure my work.
